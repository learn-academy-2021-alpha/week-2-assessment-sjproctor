// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding practical questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// Pseudo coding is HIGHLY recommended
// If you get stuck, please leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Add appropriate dependencies to the repository:
// $ yarn add jest

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Run the file with the following command:
// $ yarn jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function

// --------------------1) Create a function that takes a number as an argument and decides if the number is evenly divisble by three or not.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var num1 = 15
// Expected output: "15 is divisible by three"

var num2 = 0
// Expected output: "0 is divisible by three"

var num3 = -7
// Expected output: "-7 is not divisble by three"





// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.





// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in an array of words and returns an array with all the words capitalized.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var randomNouns1 = ["streetlamp", "potato", "teeth", "conclusion", "nephew"]
// Expected output: ["Streetlamp", "Potato", "Teeth", "Conclusion", "Nephew"]

var randomNouns2 = ["temperature", "database", "chopsticks", "mango", "deduction"]
// Expected output: ["Temperature", "Database", "Chopsticks", "Mango", "Deduction"]





// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.





// --------------------3) Create a function that takes in an array of mixed data types and returns an array with ONLY NUMBERS sorted from least to greatest.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var mixedDataArray1 = [true, 8, "hello", -8, null, 0, 46, 59, 107, "hey!"]
// Expected output: [-8, 0, 8, 46, 59, 107]

var mixedDataArray1 = [3, "yo!", 94, -9, false, 0, 18, "hola!"]
// Expected output: [-9, 0, 3, 18, 94]





// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.





// --------------------4) Create a function that takes in a string and logs the index of the first vowel.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

var vowelTester1 = "learn"
// Expected output: 1
var vowelTester2 = "academy"
// Expected output: 0
var vowelTester3 = "challenge"
// Expected output: 2





// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.
